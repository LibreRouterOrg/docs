#: 01.en.txt:100
msgid ""
"8b)\n"
"Libre use\n"
"It allows unrestricted transit to receive and offer any kind of service and "
"content, so long as it does not affect the good functioning of the network. "
"In other words, the flow of data on the network is unconditional.\n"
"Neutrality\n"
"This characteristic means data traffic is managed in an egalitarian way, "
"without discrimination based on content, platform, application or type of "
"equipment used for access. Data flows within the network are not ranked nor "
"modified arbitrarily.\n"
"Libre interconnection\n"
"This means guaranteeing the interconnection among networks, with a libre, "
"neutral and free of cost flow of data in both directions, reciprocally.\n"
"Libre transit\n"
"Two networks that have a libre transit agreement not only allow data traffic "
"between each other, but also the flow of traffic destined for other networks "
"that they have similar agreements with. The data can therefore cross one "
"libre network to reach another, expanding the reach of the \"network of "
"libre networks.\""

"In this illustartion there are two types of interconnection contracts "
"represented:\n"
"- The network of community networks have a contract among themselves as "
"equals for libre transit and for interconnection free of cost, respecting "
"neutrality. Thanks to these contracts, network 1 can communicate with "
"network 3 crossing network 2 without limitations.\n"
"- Networks 2 and 3 have a commercial service to connect with the rest of the "
"internet, via a contractual relationship that is not between peers, but "
"rather provider-consumer. This provider does not share with their clients "
"any aspect of the deployment or configuration of their network."

"Deploying therese libre community networks with a msh topology allows the "
"development of the characteristics mentioned above in a more natural way, "
"given that its basic characteristic is decentralization.\n"
"In this type of mesh network, each wireless node (router and antenna) "
"connects with one or more neighbouring nodes. In this way, the path of data "
"traffic changes automatically when one of the stops functioning. At the same "
"time, it is no longer necessary to have central access points. For these "
"reasons, mesh networks are decentralized and distributed networks."

"For a long time, libe community networks were built by the collaborative "
"work of people who prgammed and hacked. Together they developed libre "
"software and modified the available hardware, responding to the specific "
"needs of the networks.\n"
"One of the achievements was to change the proprietary software that some "
"commercial household routers came with from the factory.\n"
"This allowed the use of the routers to their full potential, enabling "
"functions that the manufacturers limited according to their market logic. "
"The contribution lowered costs notably for deployment of open, libre, "
"neutral and decentralized networks.\n"
"In August 2016, a regulation emitted by the US state agency FCC (Federal "
"Communitcations Commission) led to the manufacturers blocking the "
"substitution of the software that comes installed and configured from the "
"factory.\n"
"This action made clear that community networks were hostage to arbitrary "
"decisions in which they had little or no capacity to decide or act."
