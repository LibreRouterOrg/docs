"To give a few examples: There are networks in touristic localities that have "

"impossible to manage their network node themselves. There are also "

"Defining short- and long-term goals helps speed up and clearly orient group "

"It's to be expected that network members will show different degrees of "
"committment. Some will dedicate more effort than others or develop different "
"abilities.\n"
"Due to this, it's healthy to define a minimum committment that all members "
"should meet in order to participate in the project.\n"
"The elaboration and sharing of the network's characteristics -- such as "
"conversation about what the network is, how it's members should act, and "
"their specific roles -- gives clarity to the project."

"Periodic in-person meetings are a very important tool for creating community "

"To give some examples: there are networks that have mi-monthly meetings with "

"In other cases, talks and workshops are organized for the people who wish to "

"Deployment and initial construction of the network tends to be the most "

"To give some examples of how we can think about financing, we can loos at "
"community networks where each person who joins takes on the costs of their "

"installed, and repairs and upgrades are paid from a collective fund created "
"by monthly contributions from each member.\n"
