PARTICIPATORY MAPPING OF A LIBRE COMMUNITY NETWORK

3a)
Participatory mapping of the libre community network

3b)
The material in this booklet proposes a Participatory Mapping exercise to identify and organize information that helps develop libre community Internet networks.

3c)
Participatory maps help the community "to visualize how they perceive their territory and socio-environmental context in order to make proposals for planning and local development based on the immediate reality"

3d)
In this way, the map becomes a tool for the community speak in their own voice. The map contributes to the diagnosis of a situation in order to transform the situation through self-government and self-management of resources.

3e)
This exercise has two stages:

3f)
1st Draw an Individual Sketch

3g)
with information of each specific place where the LibreRouter nodes will be mounted.

3h)
2nd Build a Collective Map

3i)
a collaborative activity that gathers the information of all the sketches and portrays the information in a map of the territory.

4a)
The individual sketch

4b)
At this stage each member of the network gathers detailed information of where their LibreRouter node will be deployed.

4c)
The sketch includes the house or building, and surroundings at short and medium distance, with the relevant information to define the mesh structure of the community network.

4d)
Writing notes is useful, ensuring a clear and complete analysis of the area and recording details that could be forgotten.

4e)
Including the following data helps identify each place and relate the place to the rest of the sketches:

4f)
Title. For example: "Primary School Sketch"

4g)
Orientation. For example, by marking the north

4h)
Date

4i)
Contact information (telephone, e-mail, address)

5a)
In the place where the LibreRouter node will be installed, identify possible locations. Highlight the locations that allow more links with other nodes.

5b)
Remember that the nodes that link to each other require a clear line of sight.

5c)
To perform the previous steps, you have to look from the position and approximate heights of the LibreRouter antennas.

5d)
What walls or structures can the node be attached to?

5e)
What places are seen from each of these points?

5f)
Is there grid power or is alternative energy needed?

5g)
Can a local server be connected there, or service to connect with the rest of the Internet?

5h)
Wired connections between two devices can be up to 100 meters. Are there neighbors that can join to the network via wired connection?

5i)
What other relevant places are visible within two kilometers?

5j)
Are there obstacles that can be overcome to allow a line of sight with another node? For example, raising the antenna a few meters or pruning a tree.

Example 2

8a)
The collective map

8b)
This is a participatory, collaborative group activity to design the network structure, define most of the tasks and and plan the implementation.

8c)
Planning and guiding this activity is necessary due to the complexity. Choose a date that guarantees participation and choose an appropriate meeting place. The participation of more neighbors allows a more complete analysis and collective map.

8d)
Preparing the necessary materials is important. The most common materials include:

8e)
Individual sketches by the members of the network. Some neighbors may have difficulty completing their sketches. In those cases, we recommend offering support to ensure that they are finished before the collective mapping activity.

8f)
Supplies such as paper, pencils, markers, scissors, glue, ruler, thread, clips, pins.

8g)
Transparent sheets or tracing paper, if you want to put layers over the base map.

9a)
Base Map of the region on which the information is added. It can be a large print of:

9b)
a map

9c)
a satellite map

9d)
a handmade drawing

10a)
Printed or digital topographic maps are useful to consult elevations of the land in areas with mountains.

10b)
Icons to represent the elements that you want to highlight. They are simple illustrations that are easy to understand. Participants can draw the icons on the base map, or print the icons, cut them out, and paste them on the base map. Here are some examples:

11a)
Home

11b)
School

11c)
Library

11d)
Forest - Trees

11e)
Transportation stop

11f)
Sports area

11g)
River

11h)
Buildings

11i)
Public lighting post

11j)
Windmill

11k)
Mountains

11l)
Plaza - Park

11 m)
Local Radio

11n)
Tower

11o)
With all this prepared ... time to start mapping!

12a)
First, put on the map the elements identified during the process that we suggest in booklet 2, "Planning a Libre Community Network."

12b)
Next, add the information from the participants' sketches.

12c)
Consider the following information as basic:

12d)
Title. For example: "Brujo Neighborhood Libre Community Network."

12e)
Orientation, with a label for north.

12f)
Date

12g)
Notable geography of the area

12h)
Pre-existing and planned nodes. Distiguish between confirmed nodes and unconfirmed nodes.

12i)
Open spaces that are intended to have WiFi coverage.

13a)
As you build the map you begin to see the mesh structure of the network.

13b)
The objective is to design a balanced and distributed network, avoiding nodes that become too central or connections that depend on several intermediate nodes.

13c)
For WiFi connections, we recommend marking only the lines that help to orient the antennas during installation.

13d)
What possible paths can a node use to connect to the network? How can you avoid obstacles?

13e)
What connections will be WiFi? What connections will be wired?

13f)
What parts of the network will have the most use?

13g)
Are there any nodes that could be difficult to keep functional continously?

13h)
What person or institution should be invited to the network to improve the structure of the network?

13i)
The interesting thing about these networks is their capacity to enhance communication and community development. Locally-hosted services and contents (that are accessible independently of the connection to the Internet) enrich the project.

13j)
What are appropriate places for local servers or links with Internet?

13k)
Can you invite people and institutions identified as socially important during these conversations?

16a)
Ready to build!

16b)
The collective map is the first version of the network design. When we look at the map together, we can more easily define tasks in the short and medium term, and think of new ideas and solutions.

16c)
We recommend recording these ideas by writing, drawing, or taking pictures, so that you can follow the ideas over time. To take advantage of the enthusiasm, decide when you will work together to install the community network.

16d)
Achievements

16e)
60% network growth

16f)
Double path between Luis and Mar√≠a

16g)
Double path between library and school

16h)

16th)
Improve stability in important nodes

17a)
Performing activities in groups or with help between neighbors creates a stronger sense of responsibility and belonging.

17b)
This will bring you closer to the guiding objective of having a community network; a digital network, but also human network of people who know each other and collaborate.

18)
Expected results

18b)
When the members of the network finish the mapping activity, you will have advanced these objetives:

18c)
Share a vision of purpose and direction

18d)
Detect advantages and opportunities, helping with decision making

18e)
Understand the network's needs in the present and the near future

18f)
Understand your territory, adapting the community's objectives to the unique characteristics of the region

18g)
Distribute resources and tasks more efficiently

18h)
Promote interpersonal relationships between members of the network and with other people in the community

18i)
Create a visual summary of the project

20 a)
Do you have a community network project?

20b)
Count on us.

20c)
We would love to join you!
